# Cloud-Native-Scheduling

> **Objective** : Develop a mathematical model for solving the cloud-native assembly scheduling problem 

** Main Challenge : dealing with large-scale cases
** Employ the LR approach to decompose the problem into subproblems, solve by heuristic approach

### Goal : provides an effective approach to the cload-native assembly scheduling problem, where traditional methods struggle due to the complexity and scale of the problem
